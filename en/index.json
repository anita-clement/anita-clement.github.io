Usually you write a piece of code once and never touch it again. But you’ll probably get back to it several times since it’s now part of your project and each time you will have to remember how it works and what it does. That’s when readability really matters.\nPEP8 is a document designed to provide guidelines and best practices on how to write Python code. It is now considered as the reference style guide for Python code and can be found here. A package has also been developed to allow you to check your Python code against some of the PEP8 conventions (project description here). To install it using pip, run:\n1pip install pep8 .\nWe\u0026rsquo;ve only decided to list below the guidelines linked to code layout as there are many guidelines and the official guide is very clear and easy to read.\nCode Lay-out Indentation\n4 spaces per indentation level.\nIn case of line continuations (to keep lines to under 79 characters), there are two styles of indentation you can use:\n align the indented block with the opening delimiter add 4 spaces (an extra level of indentation) to distinguish arguments from the rest  1# Aligned with opening delimiter 2foo = long_function_name(var_one, var_two, 3var_three, var_four) 1# Add 4 spaces (an extra level of indentation) to distinguish arguments from the rest. 2def long_function_name( 3var_one, var_two, var_three, 4var_four): 5print(var_one) 1# Hanging indents (=every line but the first in a paragraph  2# or statement is indented) should add a level. 3foo = long_function_name( 4var_one, var_two, 5var_three, var_four) The closing brace/bracket/parenthesis on multiline constructs may either:\n line up under the first non-whitespace character of the last line of list be lined up under the first character of the line that starts the multiline construct  1my_list = [ 21, 2, 3, 34, 5, 6, 4] 5result = some_function_that_takes_arguments( 6\u0026#39;a\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;b\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;c\u0026#39;, 7\u0026#39;d\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;e\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;f\u0026#39;, 8) 1my_list = [ 21, 2, 3, 34, 5, 6, 4] 5result = some_function_that_takes_arguments( 6\u0026#39;a\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;b\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;c\u0026#39;, 7\u0026#39;d\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;e\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;f\u0026#39;, 8) Tabs or spaces?\nSpaces\nMaximum line length\n79 (72 for comments/docstrings)\nShould a line break before or after a binary operator?\nBefore\n1income = (gross_wages 2+ taxable_interest 3+ (dividends - qualified_dividends) 4- ira_deduction 5- student_loan_interest) Blank lines\n top-level functions and class definitions: 2 lines above and below method definitions inside a class: 1 line above and below  Imports\n imports should always be on separate lines imports are always put at the top of the file, just after any module comments and docstrings, and before module globals and constants.  Imports should be grouped in the following order:\n Standard library imports. Related third party imports. Local application/library specific imports.  You should put a blank line between each group of imports.\n absolute imports are recommended  1import mypkg.sibling 2from mypkg import sibling 3from mypkg.sibling import example  wildcard imports (from module import *) should be avoided  Python packages for formatting, typing and linting flake8 Flake8 is a Python library wrapping around the 3 following tools:\n PyFlakes pycodestyle Ned Batchelder’s McCabe script .  It mainly checks your code against most of PEP8\u0026rsquo;s conventions but also programming errors like unused imports or undefined names. It also checks the level of complexity in your code using Thomas J. McCabe\u0026rsquo;s cyclomatic complexity metric.\nTo install flake8 using pip, run\n1pip install flake8 .\nYou can then launch the flake8 command to check your whole project directory or you can pass a file or a directory:\n1flake8 my_dir/my_subdir/ .\nError and warning codes  E***/W***: pep8 errors and warnings F***: PyFlakes codes C9**: McCabe complexity plugin mccabe N8**: Naming Conventions plugin pep8-naming  Skipping a line or a file If you want Flake8 to skip a file, add the following comment at the top:\n1# flake8: noqa .\nIf you just want to skip a line, add a # noqa comment at the end of it. You can also ignore a spefic error by providing its error code like this: # noqa: \u0026lt;error\u0026gt;, e.g., # noqa: E101.\nblack Black is a PEP8 compliant code formatter. It reformats entire files in place. The current code style can be found here.\nTo install black using pip, run\n1pip install black .\nYou can then launch the black command to reformat your whole project directory or you can pass a file or a directory:\n1black my_dir/my_subdir/ .\nSkipping a block or a line Black won\u0026rsquo;t reformat blocks that start with # fmt: off and end with # fmt: on. It also won\u0026rsquo;t reformat lines that ends with # fmt: skip.\nRunning black on jupyter notebooks You can also reformat your jupyter notebooks to make them PEP8 compliant using nbQA in combination with black. nbQA\u0026rsquo;s documentation can be found here.\nTo install nbqa using pip, run\n1pip install nbqa .\nYou can then launch the nbqa command in combination with black to reformat your whole project directory or you can pass a single file:\n1nbqa black notebook.ipynb .\nisort isort is a Python library that sorts your imports alphabetically, and automatically separate them into sections and by type. The full documentation can be found here.\nTo install isort using pip, run\n1pip install isort .\nYou can then launch the isort command to reformat your whole project directory or you can pass several files:\n1isort myscript.py myscript2.py .\nBelow is an example before/after isort is run.\nBefore:\n1from my_lib import Object 23import os 45from my_lib import Object3 67from my_lib import Object2 89import sys 1011from third_party import lib15, lib1, lib2, lib3, lib4, lib5, lib6, lib7, lib8, lib9, lib10, lib11, lib12, lib13, lib14 1213import sys 1415from __future__ import absolute_import 1617from third_party import lib3 After:\n1from __future__ import absolute_import 23import os 4import sys 56from third_party import (lib1, lib2, lib3, lib4, lib5, lib6, lib7, lib8, 7lib9, lib10, lib11, lib12, lib13, lib14, lib15) 89from my_lib import Object, Object2, Object3 Skipping an import or a file If you want isort to skip a file, add isort:skip_file to the docstring:\n1\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; my_module.py 2Best module ever 34isort:skip_file 5\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; .\nIf you just want to skip an import, add a # isort:skip comment at the end of the corresponding line.\nRunning isort on jupyter notebooks The same way you can run black on notebooks, you can use nbQA to sort your imports in your notebooks.\nSimply launch the nbqa command in combination with isort to reformat your whole project directory or pass a specific notebook:\n1nbqa isort my_notebook.ipynb .\nmypy Mypy is a static type checker. Once you have annotated your code, mypy will help you check the code for common errors. Based on your type hints, mypy will be able to tell you that you are using the wrong type. The full documentation can be found here.\nTo install isort using mypy, run\n1pip install mypy .\nYou can then launch the mypy command to type check your whole project directory or you can pass one or several files:\n1mypy myscript.py myscript2.py .\nSkipping a line or a file You can ignore typing errors in an entire script by adding a # type: ignore or a # mypy: ignore-errors comment at the beginning of the file.\nIf you want mypy to skip a line only, add a # type: ignore comment at the end of the corresponding line.\n","date":"Mar 4, 2022","img":"","permalink":"/en/posts/python-conventions/","series":null,"tags":["Python","PEP8","flake8","black","isort","mypy"],"title":"Python Conventions"},{"categories":["Menu"],"content":"We predefined two types of menus: main and footer, represents the top app bar menus and the footer menus, respectively.
